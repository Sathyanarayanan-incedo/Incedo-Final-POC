let chappathi = {
    Dish_Name : "Chappathi",
    Dish_Type : "Vegetarian",
    Recipe : `Measure the amount of the atta flour, vegetable oil, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Some chapati recipes use only water and atta flour, nothing else! 
    The amount of water required depends on the type of flour used. It should be conservative to avoid it from becoming too wet and sticky.  You can reserve a teaspoon of water for each 100g of flour and add it to the dough while kneading if it is too dry. Once you have fixed the formula, you can, of course, add the exact amount without hesitation. In this chapati recipe, I use 75ml of water for 100g of the atta flour brand.
    Combine all the ingredients, then knead it until it picks up all the flour sticking on the mixing bowl.
    Continue kneading until it looks like plasticine, which you can leave an impression on it with your finger. 
    The easiest way is to knead it by pressing the dough with the knuckles and folding it to half after flattening it.
    The kneading process takes about five minutes for a small dough made with 100g of flour.  When you can make a clear indented mark on the dough’s surface with your fingers, it is done. 
    You can adjust the dough’s softness during kneading by either adding more water or flour if necessary.`,

let poha = {
    Dish_Name : "Poha",
    Dish_Type : "Vegetarian",
    Recipe : `I usually use medium or thick (preferred) variety of poha for this recipe. Thin poha will become quite mushy and you won't get the right texture.
    Rinse the poha till it becomes soft and let it rest in the colander while you prep and sauté the onions and potatoes.
    While adding the potatoes to the poha, make sure to dice them up real small so that they cook quickly.
    You can add peanuts for an extra bit of crunch and a touch of sugar will give a wonderful taste. I highly recommend to not skip the sugar, as it balances the flavors very well.
    In case your poha seems a dry bit, just sprinkle some water and mix it once.
    Garnishes are always a must for poha. The popular ones are lime juice, sev, and cilantro. You can also add sev or bhujia and pomegranate seeds.
    Poha is always best enjoyed immediately, but if you are storing it for later use, then keep it in an airtight container.`,

let panipuri = {
    Dish_Name : "Pani Puri",
    Dish_Type : "Vegetarian",
    Recipe : `For the puri dough, I use mainly semolina or sooji and a small quantity of wheat flour as a binding agent. Look for fine semolina 
    Add hot (but not boiling) water VERY CAREFULLY while mixing the dough, too much water can result in soggy fried lumps rather than crispy puris. The dough should be firm and not too soft
    It’s important to knead the dough well till it starts feeling smooth
    Roll the dough out as thin and evenly or else they WILL get soggy. If the dough is unevenly rolled out, it will result in thick edges or spots that won’t puff up
    You can either make small balls of dough and roll out individual puris, or roll out a bigger circle of dough evenly and use a cutter to cut circles in it
    When frying the puris, the oil’s temperature has to be controlled between medium to high flame. This will help the puris puff up instantly, and cook them properly so that they remain crisp even after cooling down
    Gently tap the puris in oil while frying for evenly puffed puris The pani puri water is what binds all the
    components together and makes the filling-filled puris such a fun experience! I make my version of 
    jaljeera with a host of spices and seasonings that boost the flavour of the pani. It is all about getting the balance right for a sweet, spicy, tangy, and sour pani. You can customise it according
    to your taste preferences. Make sure the pudina leaves are super fresh for a fresh flavour.`,
